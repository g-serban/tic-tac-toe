# tic-tac-toe

A game of Tic Tac Toe featuring a smart opponent (the computer)


But to be completely honest, I followed a code-along tutorial on Youtube for this one and after 30 minutes of watching that video I can say for certain that I don't really understand what's happening in this project.

So I'm going to remake it, using a simpler format for a Python beginner like myself.
